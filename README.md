# T-ShirtCannon

This is the software for FRC Team 766's t-shirt cannon robot. 
Built in the 2017 off-season, this robot has a west coast drivebase and uses pneumatics to shoot objects. It is driver controlled via joysticks and buttons.

The initial commit is a code upload from the robotics computer.
